         This was a resting place for the late showman who found high solace here and had wished that the land be used only for social or educational purpose. To fulfill his dream this land is developing into a large educational campus while still retaining its original serenity. This picturesque area exudes peace and tranquility and seems closer to Mother Nature in spite of being located in close proximity to the busy Pune- Satara Highway. It can be the only place for Educational Complex.
